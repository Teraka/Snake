Eventually, you should have all snake, tiles, and other graphical and game
engine classes turn on their own thread, and render to a specific renderTarget,
that you can then put in a window or something, and have menus around that
aren't frozen by the game.

For terrain tiles :
    - You can have tiles working the same way as snake sprites : One line for 
        non-collision blocks, one for collision blocks. The bit that separates
        the two lines is the collision bit.
    - Have a class with a grid of tiles that also has an int grid snakes can
        update manually through a pointer. Think very carefully about how you
        remove collision when a snake dies.
        - Also have a grid for item collision in there, to add later.

For CTF maps :
    - 2 bases, each with a flag, the goal is to cap the enemy flag as many times
        as possible.
        - You capture the flag by encircling it maybe, and lose it when burying
            or dying.
        - Can only ressurect by going in your own base. This means that a toric
            level won't cause problems if you have walls on either end : You
            can't shortcut to the enemy base without dying, and can't ressurect
            once you're there.

For weapons :
    - Maybe make weapons that reduce your snake's length, and make it that you
        die if you go under a certain length. Maybe also make "growing stations"
        in team bases.
