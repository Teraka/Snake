Don't put the command list in the snake. Put them in a control class.
The control class should handle keyboard/mouse input and dialog with the game
engine class to make the snakes step in the right direction.

Command list concept :
    - One entry per frame.
    - 2 bits to determine direction, 1 to determine burying.
    - No empty entries.
    - Keep track of last entry entered.
    - When moving forward :
        if current entry is empty, copy entry of frame f-1 (previous frame).
        else keep going.
    - When turning :
        if current entry is empty, define current entry as new direction
            if direction is compatible with previous entry.
        else define entry after last entered entry as new direction.
    - When burying :
        set current entry and D_BURIED_TIME-1(?) next entries to previous entry.

Eventually, you should have all snake, tiles, and other graphical and game engine
classes turn on their own thread, and render to a specific renderTarget, that
you can then put in a window or something, and have menus around that aren't frozen
by the game.
